        <h2>Jesus's life:</h2>
        Although born in Bethlehem, according to Matthew and Luke, Jesus was a Galilean from
         Nazareth, a village near Sepphoris, one of the two major cities of Galilee (Tiberias
          was the other). He was born to Joseph and Mary sometime between 6 bce and shortly
           before the death of Herod the Great (Matthew 2; Luke 1:5) in 4 bce. According to 
           Matthew and Luke, however, Joseph was only legally his father. They report that Mary
            was a virgin when Jesus was conceived and that she “was found to be with child from
             the Holy Spirit” (Matthew 1:18; cf. Luke 1:35). Joseph is said to have been a 
             carpenter (Matthew 13:55)—that is, a craftsman who worked with his hands—and,
              according to Mark 6:3, Jesus also became a carpenter.

Luke (2:41–52) states that Jesus as a youth was precociously learned, but there is
 no other evidence of his childhood or early life. As a young adult, he went to be baptized by 
 the prophet John the Baptist and shortly thereafter became an itinerant preacher and healer 
 (Mark 1:2–28). In his mid-30s Jesus had a short public career, lasting perhaps less than one 
 year, during which he attracted considerable attention. Sometime between 29 and 33 ce—possibly 
 30 ce—he went to observe Passover in Jerusalem, where his entrance, according to the Gospels,
  was triumphant and infused with eschatological significance. While there he was arrested, 
  tried, and executed. His disciples became convinced that he rose from the dead and appeared 
  to them. They converted others to belief in him, which eventually led to a new religion,
   Christianity.
